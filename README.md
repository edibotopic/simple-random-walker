# Simple Random Walkerüö∂üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüêï

This is a simple implementation of a random walk algorithm.

![Cover image](/simple-random-walker.p8.png "Cover image for pico-8 cart")

It is playable on desktop or mobile through the browser via a [web player](https://edibotopic.github.io/simple-random-walker/).
The `simple-random-walker.p8` file can also be downloaded from this repo and run on the [Pico-8 fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), which is just the best thing ever for small coding experiments like this.

My goal here is primarily academic and relates to proceduralism in food design, which I am currently writing about.

## Controls

The player is given four options in the main menu that generate different patterns:

- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è = DIFFUSER
- ‚û°Ô∏è = TILER
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è = BUILDER
- ‚¨áÔ∏è = BLOBBER

Making a selection initiates the random walker.
At any point the player can return to the menu by pressing <kbd>Z</kbd> (desktop/laptop) or <kbd>O</kbd> (phone).
I will probably add controls for dynamically altering the behaviour of the walker in due course.

## Use-case

This was created as *part 1 of a 3-step demo* for:

1. Procedural generation of a height map
2. Conversion of a height map to a 3D mesh
3. 3D printing of procedurally-generated structures

While drawing, the algorithm randomly selects from one of *four greyscale colours*.

This means that the images generated can be used as simple [height maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap).

This is a very limited example and the meshes that result are simple and blocky.
Greater complexity can be achieved using noise generators (e.g., Perlin) and larger colour palettes.

### Instructions

*TODO: add instructions to save images and generate heightmaps*

## Examples

*TODO: examples of generated images and corresponding height maps:*

**3D meshes (will be) generated from heightmaps using Ephtracy's Aerialod**

## Limitations

- No collisions are implemented so that walker can run off the screen (intentional)
- The name of the walker may overlap with generated patterns (intentional)
- Player cannot easily take screenshot of pattern outside of Pico-8 (unintentional)

## To-do

- [ ] Add <kbd>O</kbd> prompt to main menu
- [ ] Dynamic user influence on walkers
- [ ] Instructions on using cart within Pico-8
- [ ] Example 3D models and printed structures
- [ ] Better default behaviours
- [x] Replace grey background around cart
- [x] Change title metadata in index.html
- [ ] Option to recolour pixels during draw
- [ ] Try importing a model to picoCAD
